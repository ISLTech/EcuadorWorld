                        An orrery is a mechanical model of the Solar System that demonstrates or predicts the relative
                        positions and motions of the planets and moons, typically based on the heliocentric model. It
                        can also depict the relative sizes of these celestial bodies; however, due to the vast
                        differences in actual size ratios, a simplified approximation is often used instead. The Greeks
                        had functioning planetaria, but the first modern-era planetarium was produced around 1712 by
                        John Rowley. He named it "orrery" in honor of Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery (in County Cork,
                        Ireland). The plaque on the device reads: "Orrery invented by Graham 1700, improved by Rowley,
                        and presented by him to the Earl of Orrery, after whom it was named at the suggestion of Richard
                        Steele."

                                    the largest astronomical object in the asteroid belt, the region of the Solar System
                                    that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It was the first asteroid
                                    discovered, on January 1, 1801, by the astronomer and priest Giuseppe Piazzi from
                                    the Astronomical Observatory of Palermo in Italy. Originally considered a planet, it
                                    was reclassified as an asteroid in the 1850s when other objects in similar orbits
                                    began to be discovered. At the beginning of the 21st century, after the redefinition
                                    of "planet", it was reclassified as a dwarf planet, and is also the only one
                                    completely within the orbit of Neptune. Its diameter of approximately 945 km makes
                                    it the 33rd largest known object in the Solar System. Its mass is estimated to be
                                    one third of the total mass of the asteroid belt, making it the only object in the
                                    belt to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium.</p>

The identified objects are of many sizes, but much smaller than planets and are on average about a million kilometers (or six hundred thousand miles) apart. This asteroid belt is also called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System.</p>

It is similar to the asteroid belt, but is much larger—20 times wider and between 20 and 200 times more massive. Like the asteroid belt, it is composed mostly of small bodies or remnants from when the Solar System formed. While many asteroids are composed primarily of rock and metal, most Kuiper Belt objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (referred to as "ices"), such as methane, ammonia, and water. The Kuiper Belt is home to most of the objects that astronomers generally accept as dwarf planets: Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake. Some of the Solar System's moons, such as Neptune's Triton and Saturn's Phoebe, may have originated in the region.</p>

It is the most massive trans-Neptunian object, the second largest after Pluto, and the largest body in the Solar System not to have been visited by a space probe. It has a diameter of 2,326 ± 12 km, slightly smaller than Pluto's 2,377 ± 2 km, and a mass 27% greater than that of Pluto. In contrast, it represents only 0.27% of the mass of the Earth. It was discovered in January 2005 by a team at the Palomar Observatory led by Michael E. Brown; its identity was verified later that year. It is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO), a member of a population of high-eccentricity objects known as the scattered disk, and has a satellite named Dysnomia. These objects have been pulled into a more distant orbit than usual by gravitational interactions with Neptune in the early stages of the formation of the Solar System. As of February 2016, its distance from the Sun was 96.3 AU, about three times that of Pluto. With the exception of a few comets, Eris and Dysnomia were then the second-farthest natural objects in the Solar System (the farthest being V774104 discovered in November 2015 at 103 AU).</p>

Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.</p>

Like Mercury, it has no natural satellites. It is named after Venus, the Roman goddess of love (in Ancient Greece, Aphrodite). As the second brightest natural object after the Moon, it can be seen in a clear night sky with the naked eye. It appears at dawn and at dusk. Because of the distances of the orbits of Venus and Earth from the Sun, Venus is never visible more than three hours before sunrise or three hours after sunset.</p>

                            <p class="txtdesc">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known astronomical object to support life. This is possible because Earth is an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System to support liquid water on the surface. Nearly all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, which covers 70.8% of the Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of the Earth's crust is land, most of which is in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's terrestrial hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat moist and covered with vegetation, while large ice sheets in Earth's polar deserts hold more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust is made up of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. The Earth has a liquid outer core that creates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.</p>
